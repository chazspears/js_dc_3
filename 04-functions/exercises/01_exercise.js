Declare a variable called myNumber and assign a number value to it.

Next, declare a function called addOne that adds 1 to myNumber. After that, declare another function called subtractOne that subtracts 1 from myNumber.

Use both of your functions a few times. If there's time, write functions that add or subtract more than 1 from myNumber.
